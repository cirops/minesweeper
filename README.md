This is a conversion of Ania Kubow's Vanilla Javascript Minesweeper. You can find the original at:

## TODO:
* [] Refactor the code with DRY principles;
* [] Allow the player to click a button to start a new game;
* [] Allow the player to set the game parameters (like width and number of bombs);
* [] Think of more things to put on this list;
